This is a mobile application done as part of the mobile development course in the 5th year of my software engineering degree.
The app was coded using React Native mobile development framework to enable cross-platform compatibility, it uses firebase as a backend.
Firebase services used:
-Realtime database for messaging and profiles.
-Firebase auth for user creation and management.
also the app is connected to a storage bucket of supabase to deploy users profile images.
